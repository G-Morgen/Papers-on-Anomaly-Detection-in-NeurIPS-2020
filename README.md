**Likelihood Regret: An Out-of-Distribution Detection Score For Variational Auto-encoder** [[link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02977)]    
Zhisheng Xiao, Qing Yan, Yali Amit   
> - Recent studies show that probabilistic generative models can **assign higher likelihoods** on certain types of OOD samples, make the OOD detection rules based on *likelihood threshold* problematic.  
> - Some OOD detection methods have been proposed to solve the issue, and this paper found these methods fail on VAEs.  
> - Thus, the paper proposes **Likelihood Regret** as an alternative OOD scores for VAEs.
